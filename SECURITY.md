# Security Policy

## üîê Reporting a Vulnerability

This project intentionally contains **security vulnerabilities** for educational use in a Capture The Flag (CTF) setting. These vulnerabilities are *deliberate* and designed to simulate realistic attack vectors, such as SQL injection.

However, if you discover **unintended** vulnerabilities (e.g., issues with cookie/session handling, exposure of developer secrets, or a flaw that breaks the app in a way not intended by the challenge), please report them **privately** and responsibly.

- Email: sunnypatel124555@gmail.com
- GitHub Issues: [Create a new issue](https://github.com/sunnypatell/securebank-ctf/issues) (mark clearly as **[SECURITY]** and set it to private if needed)

Please **do not open public issues** that detail active exploit paths outside of the intended CTF challenges.

## ‚úÖ Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Provide a clear explanation of the issue and how to reproduce it
- Include proof-of-concept if applicable
- Do **not** use this project to attempt unauthorized real-world attacks
- Do **not** attempt to upload exploits, malware, or malicious payloads to the repository

## üîé Scope

This project contains *intentionally unsafe code* for educational exploitation. Vulnerabilities like the following are considered **intentional** and do **not require disclosure**:

- SQL Injection in search boxes (e.g., Transactions, Feedback)
- Feedback form tampering
- Bypassable login forms
- Unvalidated input on non-critical endpoints

## üìö For Educational Use Only

SecureBank is a CTF teaching tool modeled after apps like OWASP Juice Shop. It is **not meant for production** use. Any vulnerabilities discovered should be considered in the context of **intentional insecure design**.
